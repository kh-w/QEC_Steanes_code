# QEC_Steanes_code
I implemented Steaneâ€™s quantum error-correcting code which effectively corrects quantum errors (bit flips, phase flips, and simultaneous bit-phase flips) using a circuit composed of 7 qubits, 6 ancillary qubits, and 2 classical bits. I also demonstrated how to prepare the logical state using stablizaers
